# matrix
A linear-algebra based Go library for matrices, vectors, as well as the pageRank algorithm, the Gram-Schmidt process and more.


You can find the full package documentation on GoDoc: https://godoc.org/github.com/Timothy102/matrix.

This Go Linear Algebra Library is based on the popular Mathematics for Machine Learning Specialization on Coursera. It involves classic methods of vector and matrix operations, such as dot and inner product, and some tougher challenges, such as finding the eigenvectors of a given matrix or the Gram-Schmidt process.


I hope this library offers you to dig deeper into the world of linear algebra and to apply it to some cool machine learning concepts.
